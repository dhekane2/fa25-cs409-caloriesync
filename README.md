**CaloriSync - Adaptive Nutrition Tracker with Predictive Insights**

**Problem Statement & Motivation**

Most nutrition tracking apps focus on recording what users eat, but they rarely help
users understand how their actual eating behavior deviates from their planned goals. People often set calorie or macronutrient targets but fail to achieve them consistently, which can lead to frustration and disengagement.
Our team aims to build a web application that bridges this gap by predicting users’ expected calorie consumption and comparing it with their actual intake, providing insights and personalized feedback for healthier and more consistent habits.

**User Problems We are Solving**

There are three main problems we aim to address. First, users lack clear visibility into how closely they adhere to their nutrition goals. Second, existing calorie trackers typically display only daily totals, without revealing behavioral patterns over time. Finally, users often struggle to adjust their diets based on discrepancies between their planned and actual consumption.

**Basic Interactions our APP will Support in Service of Goal**

●	User Authentication: Each user can sign up, log in, and securely store personal data.

●	Predicted Intake: The system estimates calorie requirements based on the user’s profile (including age, gender, and activity level) or allows users to input their planned meals.

●	Actual Intake Tracking: Users can log their actual meals using the Nutritionix API, which provides detailed nutritional information.

●	Comparison & Analysis:
1. Displays predicted versus actual calorie consumption through interactive visualizations (e.g., bar or line charts).
2. Provides a “Calorie Accuracy Score” indicating how closely users meet their dietary goals.
3. Offers personalized suggestions to help improve consistency.

●	Progress Visualization: Weekly and monthly dashboards visualize adherence trends, enabling users to track long-term progress and identify behavioral patterns.

**Other APPs that are Similar**

MyFitnessPal: While MyFitnessPal offers an extensive food database and comprehensive meal logging features, it primarily functions as a calorie diary. It does not compare users’ predicted intake with their actual consumption, nor does it visualize deviations or behavioral trends over time.
Cronometer: Cronometer focuses on detailed micronutrient tracking for advanced users but lacks an intuitive way to help users understand whether they are meeting their intended dietary goals on a daily basis.
Yazio: Yazio provides meal planning and calorie tracking features but treats each day as an isolated record, without highlighting long-term trends in user accuracy or goal adherence.

**How Our App is Different**

Our app will be designed to stand out in some key ways. First, we focus on behavioral awareness rather than mere data entry, helping users understand their eating patterns instead of just recording numbers. Second, we aim to provide predictive insights and visual feedback on calorie deviations to make nutritional tracking more engaging and informative. Third, we employ a data-driven heuristic loop (predict, record, compare, then adjust) to promote continuous self-improvement. Finally, we will conduct a heuristic evaluation to refine the user experience and ensure clarity and usability in data visualization.
